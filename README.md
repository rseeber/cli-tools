# cli-tools
This repo is a collection of my attempts to re-impliment common unix command-line tools from scratch as an exercise in programming. Here's my current progress.

## cat
fairly simple program, works for no inputted file (using stdin), a single file, or multiple files.

## less
Not finished yet. Implimented using the ncurses library. Is capable of viewing a document, and scrolling up and down it using the arrow keys. Quit by pressing 'q' or sending the interrupt signal (^C).
